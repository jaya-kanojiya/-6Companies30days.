2nd question : Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not. 
A rectangle is denoted by providing the x and y coordinates of two points: 
the left top corner and the right

solution:

class Solution {
  public:
    int doOverlap(int L1[], int R1[], int L2[], int R2[]) {
        // code here
        //if rect are left nd right position
        if(L1[0] > R2[0] || L2[0] > R1[0])
         return 0;
        // if rec are top or bottom
        if(L1[1] < R2[1] || L2[1] < R1[1])
         return 0;
        return 1;
    }
};
